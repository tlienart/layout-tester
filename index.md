## Quick start

To install Franklin with Julia *≥ 1.5*, in a Julia REPL do

* hit \kbd{]} to enter package mode,
* write `add Franklin FranklinTemplates` and press \kbd{enter}.

You can then just try it out:

```julia-repl
julia> using FranklinTemplates: newsite
julia> using Franklin: serve
julia> newsite("mySite", template="pure-sm")
✓ Website folder generated at "mySite" (now the current directory).
→ Use serve() from Franklin to see the website in your browser.

julia> serve()
(...)
✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

If you navigate to that URL in your browser, you will see the website.
If you then open `mySite/index.md` in an editor and modify it at will, the changes
will be live-rendered in your browser.
